Lemma: snoc xs y .=. xs ++ [y]

Proof by induction on xs :: List a

Case []

    Show: snoc [] y .=. [] ++ [y]

    Proof
                            snoc [] y
        (by def snoc)   .=. [y]
        (by def ++)     .=. [] ++ [y]

Case x:xs
    Fix x, xs
    Assume
        IH: snoc xs y .=. xs ++ [y]
    Then
    Show: snoc (x:xs) y .=. (x:xs) ++ [y]

    Proof
                            snoc (x:xs) y
        (by def snoc)   .=. x : snoc xs y
        (by IH)         .=. x : (xs ++ [y])

                            (x:xs) ++ [y]
        (by def ++)     .=. x : (xs ++ [y])
