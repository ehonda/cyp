While matching blueprint theory with solution theory
    While matching the following functions:
        Blueprint plus alternatives:
            plus Z b = b
            plus S a b = S (plus a b)
        Solution plus alternatives:
            plus Z b = Z
            plus S a b = S (plus a b)
        Right-hand side mismatch
            Term mismatch:
                Blueprint:
                    b
                Solution:
                    Z
