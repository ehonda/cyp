While matching blueprint theory with solution theory
    While matching the following functions:
        Blueprint plus alternatives:
            plus Z b = b
            plus (S a) b = S (plus a b)
        Solution plus alternatives:
            plus Z Z = Z
            plus (S a) b = S (plus a b)
        Left-hand side mismatch
            Blueprint:
                Z b
            Solution:
                Z Z
