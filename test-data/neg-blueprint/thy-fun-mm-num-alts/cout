While matching blueprint theory with solution theory
    While matching the following functions:
        Blueprint plus alternatives:
            plus Z b = b
            plus (S a) b = S (plus a b)
        Solution plus alternatives:
            plus Z b = b
            plus (S a) b = S (plus a b)
            plus Z = Z
        Number of function alternatives doesn't match. Blueprint has 2, Solution has 3.
