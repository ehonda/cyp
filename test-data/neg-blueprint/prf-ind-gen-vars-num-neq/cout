While matching blueprint proof with solution proof
    While matching lemmas
        Blueprint lemma : length (xs ++ ys) .=. length xs + length ys
        Blueprint Induction:
            Induction variable: xs :: [a]
            Number of generalization variables doesn't match. Blueprint has 0, Solution has 1.
