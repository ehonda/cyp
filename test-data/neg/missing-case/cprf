Lemma: length (xs ++ ys) .=. length xs + length ys

Proof by induction on xs :: List a

Case []

    Show: length ([] ++ ys) .=. length [] + length ys

    Proof
                                 length ([] ++ ys)
        (by def ++)          .=. length ys

                                 length [] + length ys
        (by def length)      .=. 0 + length ys
        (by arith)           .=. length ys
