While typechecking the theory
    While inferring the types of the implicit bindings f
        While inferring the function (represented by <f>) alternative type
            <f> X = Y
            While inferring the type of a constructor pattern:
                p = X
                X :: Int -> DX
                Wrong number of arguments in p. Expected = 1, Actual = 0.
