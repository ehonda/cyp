While typechecking the theory
    While inferring the types of the implicit bindings f
        While typechecking the function (represented by <f>) alternatives
            Expected type = v2
            Alternatives:
                <f> X = Y
            While inferring the function (represented by <f>) alternative type
                <f> X = Y
                While inferring the type of a constructor pattern:
                    p = X
                    X :: Int -> DX
                    Wrong number of arguments in p. Expected = 1, Actual = 0.
