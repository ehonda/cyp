Lemma invalid: g . f .=. id 
  Proof by extensionality with x
    Show: (g . f) x .=. id x
      Proof by case analysis on Bool x
        Case True
          Assume
            AS: x .=. True
          Then
          Proof
                            (g . f) x
            (by AS)     .=. (g . f) True
            (by def .)  .=. g (f True)
            (by def f)  .=. g X
            (by def g)  .=. True
            (by def id) .=. id True
            (by AS)     .=. id x

        Case False
          Assume
            AS: x .=. False
          Then
          Proof
                            (g . f) x
            (by AS)     .=. (g . f) False
