Lemma wmin_Z_right_id: wmin x Z .=. x

Proof by induction on x :: N
  Case Z
    Show: wmin Z Z .=. Z

    Proof
      wmin Z Z
      (by def wmin) .=. Z
    QED

  Case S x
    Fix x :: N
    Assume
      IH: wmin x Z .=. x
    Then
    Show: wmin (S x) Z .=. S x

    Proof
      wmin (S x) Z
      (by def wmin) .=. S (wmin x Z)
      (by IH) .=. S x
